                    Hi, I'm Milo Etz—a passionate computer scientist with a minor in design and a love for creativity.
                    I specialize in crafting unique solutions at the intersection of technology and art. From building
                    meeting trackers using React and voice data to experimenting with Raspberry Pi for interactive art
                    installations, my projects reflect my curiosity and drive for innovation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether it's developing user-focused web applications or exploring the nostalgic charm of CRT displays,
                    I aim to create experiences that connect with people and solve real-world problems.
                </p>
